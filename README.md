# The Ultimate Guide to Multimodal RAG Pipelines

## What is RAG?

**RAG = Retrieval + Augmented + Generation**

RAG connects LLMs to external knowledge sources, allowing them to:
- ✅ Answer with current, accurate information
- ✅ Reference specific sources (no hallucination)
- ✅ Handle domain-specific knowledge
- ✅ Scale beyond the model's training data

Think of it as giving an LLM access to a searchable library before answering.
